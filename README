This removes Adobe Flash from windows completely.
The WHY: if you runt the flash uninstaller provided by Adobe it does it does "superficially".
You will still see flash running in Skype for example an other "services" that track and sell \
ads throughout the windows.

Run it and contribute to the end of the "CrapWare" by the behemots.
